> Correct
> 
> ### Recall that the cardinality of a set is the number of elements in it. Since EEE has three elements (which are −1−1−1, −2−2−2, −3−3−3), the cardinality of EEE is ∣E∣|E|∣E∣ =3.= 3.=3.

> ### The intersection of two sets consists precisely of the elements they share in common. The elements 333 and 555 are in both AAA and BBB.
