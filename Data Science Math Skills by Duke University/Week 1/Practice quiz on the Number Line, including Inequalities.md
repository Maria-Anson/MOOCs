> ### The absolute value of a number xxx is the distance along the number line from xxx to 000. In this case, −7-7−7 is 777 units away from 000, and so ∣−7∣=7|-7| = 7∣−7∣=7.

> 3.

> Question 3
> 
> ### Suppose I tell you that xxx and yyy are two real numbers which make the statement xxx <y< y<y true. Which pair of numbers _**cannot**_ be values for xxx and yyy?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  ### x=−1x=-1x=−1 and y=0y=0y=0 
> 

      x === 5 and y === 3.3 
> 
>  ### xxx === −17.3−17.3−17.3 and yyy === −17.1−17.1−17.1 
> 
>  ### xxx === 111 and yyy === 7.37.37.3 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### The statement xxx <<< yyy means that xxx is to the left of yyy on the real number line. Since 555 is to the right of 3.33.33.3, these cannot be values for xxx and yyy.
> 
> 4.
> 
> Question 4
> 
> ### Suppose I tell you that www is a real number which makes both of the following statements true: www >>>111 and www <<< 1.21.21.2. Which of the following numbers could be www?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  ### www === 1.21.21.2 
> 
>  ### www === 000 
> 

      w === 1.05 
> 
>  ### www === 111111 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### 1.051.051.05 >>> 111 is true since 1.051.051.05 is to the right of 111 on the real number line, and 1.051.051.05 <<< 1.21.21.2 is also true, since 1.051.051.05 is to the left of 1.21.21.2 on the real number line.

> ### Suppose that xxx and yyy are two real numbers which satisfy xxx+++ 333 === 444yyy +++ 111. **Which of the following statements are false?**
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  ### xxx === 444yyy −2-2−2

> 
> Check

> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### Recall that the open interval (2,3)(2, 3)(2,3) consists of all real numbers xxx which satisfy 2<x<32 < x < 32<x<3. Since 2.1>22.1 > 22.1>2 and 2.1<32.1 < 32.1<3, the number 2.12.12.1 is in this open interval.
> 
> 7.
> 
> Question 7
> 
> ### Which of the following real numbers are in the open ray (3.1,∞) (3.1, ∞)(3.1,∞)?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  ### 000 
> 
>  ### 3.13.13.1 
> 
    
      4.75 
> 
>  ### −5-5−5 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### Recall that (3.1,∞)={x∈R(3.1, \infty) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} (3.1,∞)={x∈R| x>3.1}x \gt 3.1 \}x>3.1}. Since 4.75>3.14.75 \gt 3.14.75>3.1 is true, 4.75∈(3.1,∞)4.75 \in (3.1, \infty)4.75∈(3.1,∞).

> 8.
> 
> Question 8
> 
> ### Which of the following values for xxx solves the equation −3x+2=−4-3x +2 = -4 −3x+2=−4
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  ### All values of xxx such that x≤2x\leq 2x≤2 
> 
>  ### x=−2x=-2x=−2 
> 
>  ### x=23x=\begin {align}\frac {2} {3}\end {align} 
> 

    x=2 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### First we subtract 222 from both sides of the given equation, to obtain −3x=−6−3x = −6−3x=−6. Finally, to isolate xxx we divide both sides of the equation by −3−3−3 to obtain x=2x = 2x=2.
