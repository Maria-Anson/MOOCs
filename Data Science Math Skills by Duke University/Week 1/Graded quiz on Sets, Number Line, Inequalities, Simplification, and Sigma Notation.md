> ### Let B={3,5,10,11,14}B=\{3, 5, 10, 11, 14\}B={3,5,10,11,14}. Is the following statement true or false: 333 ∉\notin∈/​ BBB
>

> 

      False 
> 
>  ### True 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### The symbol ∉\notin∈/​ stands for “is not an element of.” Since 333 is in an element of the set BBB, the given statement is not true.

> Question 4
> 
> ### Suppose I tell you that xxx and yyy are two real numbers which make the statement xxx ≥\geq≥ yyy true. Which pair of numbers _**cannot**_ be values for xxx and yyy?
>

      x=−1 and y=0 
> 
>  ### xxx === 555 and yyy === 3.33.33.3 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### Recall that the statement xxx ≥\geq≥ yyy means that xxx is either equal to yyy or xxx is to the right of yyy on the real number line. Since −1-1−1 is actually to the left of 000, these cannot be values for xxx and yyy.

        −5z<−5w 
> 
>  ### −z>−w-z>-w−z>−w 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### If we start with zzz <<< www and multiply both sides by −5−5−5, we need to flip the less-than sign, which would give −5z>−5w−5z > −5w−5z>−5w. For an example, try z=1z = 1z=1 and y=2y = 2y=2 and see what happens!

> ### We compute Σk=252k=4+6+8+10=28.{\large \displaystyle{\Sigma_{k=2}^5 2k}} = 4 + 6+ 8 + 10 = 28.Σk=25​2k=4+6+8+10=28.

> 
> ### By applying one of our Sigma notation simplification rules, we can rewrite the summation in question as 2(Σk=120k)=2×210=420.{\large 2\left(\Sigma_{k=1}^{20} k\right)} = 2 \times 210 = 420.2(Σk=120​k)=2×210=420.

> ### According to one of our Sigma notation simplification rules, this summation is just equal to 999 copies of the number 777 all added together, and so we get 9⋅7=63.9 \cdot 7 = 63.9⋅7=63.

> ### To get the variance of a set of numbers, you need to perform four steps:
> 
> ### First compute the mean (which is 333)
> 
> ### Then calculate all the squared differences between the numbers in the set and this mean (here you get 25,1,1625,1,1625,1,16)
> 
> ### Then add all these up (here you get 424242)
> 
> ### Then divide by the number of elements in the set (which is 333).
> 
> ### Therefore, the variance of ZZZ
> 
> ### =13[(−2−3)2+(4−3)2+(7−3)2]= \begin {align}\frac13[(-2-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (7-3)^2]\end {align}
