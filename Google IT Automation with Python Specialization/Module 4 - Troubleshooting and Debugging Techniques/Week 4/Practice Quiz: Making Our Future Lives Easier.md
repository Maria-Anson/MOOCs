>  1.Question 1
> 
> Which proactive practice can you implement to make troubleshooting issues in a program easier when they happen again, or face other similar issues?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Create and update documentation 
> 
>  Use a test environment. 
> 
>  Automate rollbacks. 
> 
>  Set up Unit tests. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> You got it! Documentation that includes good instructions on how to resolve an issue can assist in resolving the same, or similar issue in the future.
> 
>  2.Question 2
> 
> Which of the following is a good example of mixing and matching resources on a single server so that the running services make the best possible use of all resources?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Run two applications that are CPU intensive between two servers. 
> 
>  Run a CPU intensive application on one server, and an I/O intensive application on another server. 
> 

      Run a RAM intensive application and a CPU intensive application on a server. 
> 
>  Run two applications that are RAM and I/O intensive on a server. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Great work! An application that uses a lot of RAM can still run while CPU is mostly used by another application on the same server.
> 
>  3.Question 3
> 
> One strategy for debugging involves explaining the problem to yourself out loud. What is this technique known as?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Monitoring

> 
>  Testing 
> 
>  Ticketing 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Right on! Rubber ducking is the process of explaining a problem to a "rubber duck", or rather yourself, to better understand the problem.

>  4.Question 4
> 
> When deploying software, what is a canary?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  A test for how components of a program interact with each other 
> 
>  A test of a programâ€™s components 
> 

      A test deployment to a subset of production hosts 
> 
>  A small section of code 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Nice job! Reminiscent of the old term "canary in a coal mine", a canary is a test deployment of our software, just to see what happens.
> 
>  5.Question 5
> 
> It is advisable to collect monitoring information into a central location. Given the importance of the server handling the centralized collecting, when assessing risks from outages, this server could be described as what?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      A failure domain 
> 
>  A problem domain 
> 
>  CPU intensive 
> 
>  I/O intensive 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Awesome! A failure domain is a logical or physical component of a system that might fail.
