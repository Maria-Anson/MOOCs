>  Threading 
> 
>  Performance analysis 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Right on!Â  Concurrency in computer science is the ability of different sections or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out of order or in partial order, without impacting the final result.

>  5.Question 5
> 
> What would we call a program that often leaves our CPU with little to do as it waits on data from a local disk and the Internet?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Memory-bound 
> 
>  CPU-bound 
> 
>  User-bound 
> 

      I/O bound 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Right on! If our program mainly finds itself waiting on local disks or the network, it is I/O bound.
