> Question 7
> 
> Is it always true that the model with the most trees will perform best on the test/validation set?
> 
> 1 point
> 
>  Yes, a model with more trees will ALWAYS perform better on the test/validation set. 
> 

      No, a model with more trees does not always perform better on the test/validation set.

> ### 8.
> 
> Question 8

> ### 9.
> 
> Question 9
> 
> Is it always true that the test/validation error will reduce as the number of trees increases?
> 
> 1 point
> 
>  Yes, it is ALWAYS true that the test/validation error will reduce as the number of trees increases. 
> 

      No, the test/validation error will not necessarily always reduce as the number of trees increases.
