> Suppose our goal was to produce 10 approximate nearest neighbors whose average distance from the query document is within 0.01 of the average for the true 10 nearest neighbors. For Barack Obama, the true 10 nearest neighbors are on average about 0.77\. What was the smallest search radius for Barack Obama that produced an average distance of 0.78 or better?
