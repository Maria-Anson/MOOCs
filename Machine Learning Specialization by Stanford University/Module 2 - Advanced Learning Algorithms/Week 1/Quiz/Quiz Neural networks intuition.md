> Which of these are terms used to refer to components of an artificial neural network?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      layers 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Yes, a layer is a grouping of neurons in a neural network
> 

      neurons 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Yes, a neuron is a part of a neural network
> 

      activation function 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Yes, an activation is the number calculated by a neuron (and an activation is a vector that is output by a layer that contains multiple neurons).
> 
>  axon

> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> True/False? Neural networks take inspiration from, but do not very accurately mimic, how neurons in a biological brain learn.

> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  False 
> 

      True 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Artificial neural networks use a very simplified mathematical model of what a biological neuron does.
