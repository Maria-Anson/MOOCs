# Practice quiz: Advice for applying machine learning
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> In the context of machine learning, what is a diagnostic?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  This refers to the process of measuring how well a learning algorithm does on a test set (data that the algorithm was not trained on). 
> 
>  A process by which we quickly try as many different ways to improve an algorithm as possible, so as to see what works. 
> 
>  An application of machine learning to medical applications, with the goal of diagnosing patients’ conditions. 
> 

      A test that you run to gain insight into what is/isn’t working with a learning algorithm. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Yes! A diagnostic is a test that you run to gain insight into what is/isn’t working with a learning algorithm, to gain guidance into improving its performance.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> True/False? It is always true that the better an algorithm does on the training set, the better it will do on generalizing to new data.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      False 
> 
>  True 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Actually, if a model overfits the training set, it may not generalize well to new data.

> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3

> 
> For a classification task; suppose you train three different models using three different neural network architectures. Which data do you use to evaluate the three models in order to choose the best one?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  All the data -- training, cross validation and test sets put together. 
> 
>  The training set 
> 
>  The test set 
> 

      The cross validation set 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Use the cross validation set to calculate the cross validation error on all three models in order to compare which of the three models is best.
