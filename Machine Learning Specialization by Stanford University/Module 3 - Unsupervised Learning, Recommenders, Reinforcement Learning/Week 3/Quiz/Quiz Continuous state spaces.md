      The state contains numbers such as position and velocity that are continuous valued 
> 
>  The state-action value Q(s,a) function outputs continuous valued numbers 
> 
>  The state has multiple numbers rather than only a single number (such as position in the x-direction) 
> 
>  The reward contains numbers that are continuous valued

> In the learning algorithm described in the videos, we repeatedly create an artificial training set to which we apply supervised learning where the input x = (s,a) and the target, constructed using Bellman’s equations, is y = _____?
