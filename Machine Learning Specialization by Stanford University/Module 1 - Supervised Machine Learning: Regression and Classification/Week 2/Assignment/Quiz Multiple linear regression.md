> Correct
> 
> Yes! x4(3)x_4^{(3)}x4(3)​ is the 4th feature (4th column in the table) of the 3rd training example (3rd row in the table).
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> Which of the following are potential benefits of vectorization? Please choose the best option.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  It makes your code run faster 
> 
>  It can make your code shorter 
> 
>  It allows your code to run more easily on parallel compute hardware 
> 

      All of the above 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! All of these are benefits of vectorization!
> 
> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> True/False? To make gradient descent converge about twice as fast, a technique that almost always works is to double the learning rate alphaalphaalpha.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      False 
> 
>  True 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Doubling the learning rate may result in a learning rate that is too large, and cause gradient descent to fail to find the optimal values for the parameters www and bbb.
