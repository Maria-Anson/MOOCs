> Question 1
> 
> For linear regression, the model is fw,b(x)=wx+bf_{w,b}(x) = wx + bfw,b​(x)=wx+b.
> 
> Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      xxx 
> 
>  www and bbb. 
> 
>  (x,y)(x,y)(x,y) 
> 
>  mmm 
> 
> Correct
> 
> The xxx, the input features, are fed into the model to generate a prediction fw,b(x)f_{w,b}(x)fw,b​(x)

> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> For linear regression, if you find parameters www and bbb so that J(w,b)J(w,b)J(w,b) is very close to zero, what can you conclude?
> 
> 1 / 1 point


      The selected values of the parameters www and bbb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well. 
> 
>  This is never possible -- there must be a bug in the code. 
> 
>  The selected values of the parameters www and bbb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really poorly. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> When the cost is small, this means that the model fits the training set well.
