> ### Learning Objectives
> 
> **In this module you will learn about:**
> 
> *   How to train your machine learning model using [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/) ​(part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data)
> *   How to scale your model training using multi CPU or GPU runtimes
> 
> In the previous sections you learned how to train various deep learn models. This section you will learn how to use Watson Studio to scale model training to multipe CPUs or GPUs. You don't need a credit card and up to 100 hours of free runtimes are included, every month, never expiring
> 
> Please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/Watson-Studio-Setup) to setup your project in Watson Studio.
> 
> Then, please import the following notebook into Watson Studio and follow the instructions within the notebook. Instructions on how to import can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/skillsnetwork/wiki/Watson-Studio-Notebook-Import).
