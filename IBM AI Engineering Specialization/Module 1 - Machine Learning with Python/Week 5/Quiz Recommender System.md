> 
> What is/are the advantage/s of Recommender Systems ? 
> 
>  Recommender Systems provide a better experience for the users by giving them a broader exposure to many different products they might be interested in. 
> 
>  Recommender Systems encourage users towards continual usage or purchase of their product 
> 
>  Recommender Systems benefit the service provider by increasing potential revenue and better security for its consumers.

      All of the above.

> 
> What is a **content-based recommendation system**? 
> 

      Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items to the users based on their profile built upon their preferences and taste. 
> 
>  Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items based on similarity among items. 
> 
>  Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items based on the similarity of users when buying, watching, or enjoying something.

> 
> What is the meaning of "**Cold start**" in collaborative filtering? 
> 
>  The difficulty in recommendation when we do not have enough ratings in the user-item dataset. 
> 

      The difficulty in recommendation when we have new user, and we cannot make a profile for him, or when we have a new item, which has not got any rating yet. 
> 
>  The difficulty in recommendation when the number of users or items increases and the amount of data expands, so algorithms will begin to suffer drops in performance.

>  4.Question 4
> 
> What is a "**Memory-based**" recommender system? 
> 
>  In memory based approach, a model of users is developed in attempt to learn their preferences. 
> 
>  In memory based approach, a recommender system is created using machine learning techniques such as regression, clustering, classification, etc. 
> 

      In memory based approach, we use the entire user-item dataset to generate a recommendation system.

>  5.Question 5
> 
> What is the shortcoming of content-based recommender systems? 
> 
>  It needs to find similar group of users, so suffers from drops in performance, simply due to growth in the similarity computation. 
> 

      Users will only get recommendations related to their preferences in their profile, and recommender engine may never recommend any item with other characteristics. 
> 
>  As it is based on similarity among items and users, it is not easy to find the neighbour users.
