> 
> Which of the following is the meaning of "**Out of Sample Accuracy**" in the context of evaluation of models? 
> 

      "Out of Sample Accuracy" is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that the model has NOT been trained on. 
> 
>  "Out of Sample Accuracy" is the accuracy of an overly trained model (which may captured noise and produced a non-generalized model)

> 
> When should we use **Multiple Linear Regression**? 
> 
>  When there are multiple dependent variables 
> 

      When we would like to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable. 
 
      When we would like to predict impacts of changes in independent variables on a dependent variable.

> Which of the following statements are **TRUE** about **Polynomial Regression**?

      Polynomial regression fits a curve line to your data. 
     
      Polynomial regression can use the same mechanism as Multiple Linear Regression to find the parameters. 
     
      Polynomial regression models can fit using the Least Squares method.

> Which sentence is **NOT TRUE** about **Non-linear Regression**? 
> 
>  Nonlinear regression is a method to model non linear relationship between the dependent variable and a set of independent variables. 
> 
>  For a model to be considered non-linear, y must be a non-linear function of the parameters. 
> 
    
      Non-linear regression must have more than one dependent variable.
