> Which answer is true?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Machine Learning Pipelines run faster than individual data processing steps since in a pipeline all processing is fused into a smaller amount of low level machine instructions 
> 

      Machine Learning Pipelines allow for reuse of data preprocessing steps to switch and swap different algorithms in and out in order to obtain the best model
