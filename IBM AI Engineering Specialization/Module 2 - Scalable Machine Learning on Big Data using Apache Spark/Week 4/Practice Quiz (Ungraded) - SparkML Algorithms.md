      Apache SparkML has it's own implementation of Clustering, Classification and Regression algorithms since they need to make use of the parallel Apache Spark APIs .Therefore it is possible to find an algorithm in the scikit-learn package which is not available in Apache Spark

      It depends on the dataset which algorithm/model performs best. Usually Linear Regression/Logistic Regression is used as a baseline and other algorithms tend to perform better but exceptions to this rule exist
