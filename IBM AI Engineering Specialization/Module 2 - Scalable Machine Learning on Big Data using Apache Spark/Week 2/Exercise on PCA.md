You can either have a [look](https://github.com/IBM/coursera/blob/master/coursera_ds/a0_m4_exercice3.2_spark2.3_python3.5_cos.ipynb) at it or [import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/coursera/master/coursera_ds/a0_m4_exercice3.2_spark2.3_python3.5_cos.ipynb) it to Data Science Experience and play around with it (highly recommended).
