>  1.Question 1
> 
> Why is the convolutional layer important in convolutional neural networks?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Because a convolutional layer would make the model overfit the training data so that it generalizes better 
> 
>  Because convolutional neural networks are unsupervised deep learning models and therefore, a convolutional layer helps the model better fit the data 
> 

      Because if we do not use a convolutional layer, we will end up with a massive number of parameters that will need to be optimized and it will be super computationally expensive 
> 
>  Because convolutional neural networks take flattened images as input and therefore the convolutional layer helps the model regenerate the input images

      An autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network model that uses backpropagation by setting the target variable to be the same as the input 
> 
>  An autoencoder consists of a series of convolutional, ReLU, and pooling layers, as well as a number of fully connected layers 
> 
>  Just like conventional neural networks, a convolutional neural network takes (n x 1) vectors as input

>  Recurrent neural networks are best for solving problems related to image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision applications
