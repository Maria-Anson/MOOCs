> For this week, your main task is to decide whether you want to use the shared data or find your own dataset. In case, you choose to find your own dataset from the resources that are suggested in Week-1 video, your dataset should meet the following criteria: 
> 
> 1.  The target or label columns should be accident " severity" in terms of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact. 
> 2.  The machine learning model should be able to predict accident "severity"
> 3.  To build a good model, the dataset should be rich and contain many observations (rows) and various attributes (columns)
