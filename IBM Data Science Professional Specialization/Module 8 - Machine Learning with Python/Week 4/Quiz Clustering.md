> 
> Which statement is **NOT TRUE** about k-means clustering? 
> 
>  k-means divides the data into non-overlapping clusters without any cluster-internal structure. 
> 
>  The objective of k-means, is to form clusters in such a way that similar samples go into a cluster, and dissimilar samples fall into different clusters. 
> 

      As k-means is an iterative algorithm, it guarantees that it will always converge to the global optimum.

>  2.Question 2
> 
> Which of the following are characteristics of DBSCAN? Select all that apply. 
> 

      DBSCAN can find arbitrarily shaped clusters. 
> 

      DBSCAN can find a cluster completely surrounded by a different cluster. 
> 

      DBSCAN has a notion of noise, and is robust to outliers. 
> 
    
      DBSCAN does not require one to specify the number of clusters such as k in k-means

>  Minkowski distance

> 
> How is a center point (centroid) picked for each cluster in k-means? 
> 

      We can randomly choose some observations out of the data set and use these observations as the initial means. 
> 

      We can create some random points as centroids of the clusters. 
> 
>  We can select it through correlation analysis.
