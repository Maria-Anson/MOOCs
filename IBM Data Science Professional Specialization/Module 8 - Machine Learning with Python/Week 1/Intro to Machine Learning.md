>  2.Question 2
> 
> Which of the following is **not true** about Machine Learning? 
> 
>  Machine Learning was inspired by the learning process of human beings. 
> 
>  Machine Learning models iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights. 
> 
>  Machine Learning models help us in tasks such as object recognition, summarization, and recommendation. 
> 
  
      Machine learning gives computers the ability to make decision by writing down rules and methods and being explicitly programmed.

> 
> Which of the following groups are not Machine Learning techniques? 
> 

      Classification and Clustering 
> 
>  Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-Learn

> 
>  4.Question 4
> 
> The "Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for: 
> 
    
      Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics. 
> 
>  Prediction of class/category of a case; for example a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not. 
> 
>  Finding items/events that often co-occur; for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer. 
> 
> 3 points
> 
>  5.Question 5
> 
> When comparing Supervised with Unsupervised learning, is this sentence True or False?
> 
> In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate.
