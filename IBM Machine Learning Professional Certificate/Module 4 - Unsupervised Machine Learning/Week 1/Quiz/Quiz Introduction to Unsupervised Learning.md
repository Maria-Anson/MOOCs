# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> Which statement about unsupervised algorithms is TRUE?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Unsupervised algorithms are relevant when we have outcomes we are trying to predict. 
> 

      Unsupervised algorithms are relevant when we donâ€™t have the outcomes we are trying to predict and when we want to break down our data set into smaller groups. 
> 
>  Unsupervised algorithms are typically used to forecast time related patterns like stock market trends or sales forecasts. 
> 
>  Unsupervised algorithms are relevant in cases that require explainability, for example comparing parameters from one model to another. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! They are helpful to find structures within our data set and when we want to partition our data set into smaller pieces for a better performance.

      Explaining the relationship between an individual's income and the price they pay for a car. 
> 
>  Grouping observations together to find similar patterns across them. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! This is an example best suited for regression, which is a supervised learning model.

> What is one of the real-world solutions to fix the problems of the curse dimensionality?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Increase the size of the data set 
> 
>  Use more computational power

    Reduce the dimension of the data set.

>  Balance the classes of a data set 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! By doing dimensionality reduction we can improve both the performance and the interpretability of this grouping.
