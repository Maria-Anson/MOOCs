# K Nearest Neighbors Labs
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> (True/False) An advantage of k nearest neighbor methods is that they can leverage categorical data without encoding.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  True 
> 

      False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! If you are using sklearn nearest neighbors implementation, you will need to use encoding on your categorical data. You can find an example on how to do this on the demonstration.

> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> Usually the first step to fit a k nearest neighbor classifier using scikit learn is to:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  import KNN from the sklearn.knearestneighbors module
> 
> e.g. from sklearn.knearestneighbors import KNN 
> 

      import KneighborsClassifier from the sklearn.neighbors module
> 
> e.g. from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 
> 
>  import Classifier from the sklearn.nearestneighbors module
> 
> e.g. from sklearn.nearestneighbors import Classifier 
> 
>  import KNNClassifier from the sklearn.knearestneighbors module
> 
> e.g. from sklearn.knearestneighbors import KNNClassifier 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! This is the correct way to import KNeighborsClassifier! You can find more information on the sklearn documentation or in the K Nearest Neighbor Jupyter Notebook demonstration.
