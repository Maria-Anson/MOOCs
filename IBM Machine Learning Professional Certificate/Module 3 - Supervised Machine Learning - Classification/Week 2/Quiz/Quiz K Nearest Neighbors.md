# K Nearest Neighbors
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> (True/False) A simplified way to interpret K Nearest Neighbors is by thinking of the output of this method as a decision boundary which is then used to classify new points.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the lesson _K Nearest Neighbors Decision Boundary_.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> These are all characteristics of the k nearest neighbors algorithm EXCEPT:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  It is sensitive to scaling 
> 
>  It determines decision boundaries to make predictions 
> 

      It determines the value for _k_ 
> 
>  It is well suited to predict variables with multiple classes 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! The value of k is a hyperparameter that needs to be determined and optimized.
