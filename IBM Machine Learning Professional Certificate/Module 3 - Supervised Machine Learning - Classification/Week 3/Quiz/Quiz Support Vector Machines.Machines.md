> Question 1
> 
> All of these are characteristics of SVMs, EXCEPT:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Support Vector Machines do not return predicted probabilities. 
> 
>  Support Vector Machines use decision boundaries for classification. 
> 
>  The algorithm behind Support Vector Machines calculates hyperplanes that minimize misclassification error. 
> 

      Support Vector Machine models are non-linear. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! SVMs are linear models. For more information please review the lesson _Regularization in Support Vector Machines_.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> (True/False) SVMs calculate predicted probabilities in the range between 0 and 1.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  True 
> 

      False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! A SVM model is a linear model that does not output predicted probabilities. Instead, it outputs labels determined by the decision boundary assigned to the region where an observation belongs. You can find more information in the lesson _Regularization in Support Vector Machines_.
