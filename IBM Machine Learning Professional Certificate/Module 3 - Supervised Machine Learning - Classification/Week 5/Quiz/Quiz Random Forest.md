> Correct! The main difference between random forests and bagging, is that random forests introduce more randomness by using only subsets of features, not only subsets of observations. And in general, they tend to have better out of sample accuracy.

      import random forest classifer from the sklearn.ensemble module
     
     e.g. from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifer

> Correct! This is the correct way to import a random forest classifier using sklearn. You can find more information on the sklearn documentation or in the Random Forest lesson.
