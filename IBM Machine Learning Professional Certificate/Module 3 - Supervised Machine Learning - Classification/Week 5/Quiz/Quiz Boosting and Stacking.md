# Boosting and Stacking
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> (True/False) Boosting tend to be well suited for data sets with outliers and rare events.
> 
> 1 / 1 point

      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! The nature of boosting algorithms tends to produce good results in the presence of outliers and rare events. You can find more information on the Boosting and Stacking lesson.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> All of these are characteristics of boosting algorithms, EXCEPT:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  They use the entire data set, not only bootstrapped samples 
> 
>  They use residuals from previous models 
> 
>  They create trees iteratively 
> 

      They create trees independently 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! Boosting algorithms create trees iteratively, not independently, by boosting observations with high residuals from the previous tree model. You can find more information in the Boosting lesson.
