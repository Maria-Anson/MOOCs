# Modeling Unbalanced Classes
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> These are all methods of dealing with unbalanced classes EXCEPT:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Downsampling. 
> 

      Mix of in-sample and out-of-sample. 
> 
>  Mix of downsampling and upsampling. 
> 
>  Upsampling. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the lesson _Upsampling and Downsampling_.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> (True/False) A best practice to build a model using unbalanced classes is to split the data first, then apply an upsample or undersample technique.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! A best practice is to do a stratified train/test split before, then use an upsample or downsample technique, and last build a predictive model. You can find more information in the lesson _Upsampling and Downsampling_.
