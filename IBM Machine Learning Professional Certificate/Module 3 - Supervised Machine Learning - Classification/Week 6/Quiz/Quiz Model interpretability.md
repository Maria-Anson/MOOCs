# Practice: Model interpretability
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> What type of forest is a classification algorithm that potentially contains hundreds of different decision trees?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  The Multiple Forest 
> 
>  Global Forest 
> 
>  Model Forest 
> 

      Random Forest 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! A Random Forest is a classification algorithm that potentially contains hundreds of different decision trees
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> When describing models what type of model will feature coefficients help to explain?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  KNN 
> 
>  Global Surrogate model 
> 

      Linear Model 
> 
>  SVM 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! Feature coefficients help to explain linear models.
> 
> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> What type of surrogate model tries to approximate a black-box model globally on every instance in the data set?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Strategic Surrogate model 
> 
>  Complex Surrogate model 
> 

      Global Surrogate model 
> 
>  Local Surrogate model 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! The Global Surrogate model tries to approximate a black-box model globally on every instance in the data set?
