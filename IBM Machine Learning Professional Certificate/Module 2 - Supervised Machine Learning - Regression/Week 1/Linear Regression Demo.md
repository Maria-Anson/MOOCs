# Linear Regression Demo (Activity)
> 
> In this demonstration, you will import the Boston data set to train a regression model that predicts the median value of a house. 
> 
> *   You will test whether the dependent variable is normally distributed, which is preferred but not required. 
> 
> *   You will create polynomial features. 
> 
> *   You will also learn by example how to use the train_test_split function to split your data into training and testing.
