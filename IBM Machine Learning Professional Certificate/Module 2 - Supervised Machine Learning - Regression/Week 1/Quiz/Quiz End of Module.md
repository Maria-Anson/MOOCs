> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> You can use supervised machine learning for all of the following examples, EXCEPT:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      Segment customers by their demographics. 
> 
>  Predict the number of customers that will visit a store on a given week. 
> 
>  Predict the probability of a customer returning to a store. 
> 
>  Interpret the main drivers that determine if a customer will return to a store. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information on the Introduction to Machine Learning lesson
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> The autocorrect on your phone is an example of:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Unsupervised learning 
> 
      Supervised learning 
> 
>  Semi-supervised learning 
> 
>  Reinforcement learning 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! Find more information in the Types of Machine Learning lesson.
> 
> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> This is the type of Machine Learning that uses both data with labeled outcomes and data without labeled outcomes:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Supervised Machine Learning 
> 
>  Unsupervised Machine Learning 
> 
>  Mixed Machine Learning 
> 
      Semi-Supervised Machine Learning 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the lesson _Types of Machine Learning?_
> 
> ### 4.
> 
> Question 4
> 
> This option describes a way of turning a regression problem into a classification problem:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      Create a new variable that flags 1 for above a certain value and 0 otherwise 
> 
>  Use outlier treatment 
> 
>  Use missing value handling 
> 
>  Create a new variable that uses autoencoding to transform a continuous outcome into categorical 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! Find more information in the Types of Machine Learning lesson.
> 
> ### 5.
> 
> Question 5
> 
> This is the syntax you need to predict new data after you have trained a linear regression called _LR_:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  LR=predict(X_test) 
> 
      LR.predict(X_test) 
> 
>  LR.predict(LR, X_test) 
> 
>  predict(LR, X_test) 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! Please review the Linear Regression lesson for more information.
> 
> ### 6.
> 
> Question 6
> 
> All of these options are useful error measures to compare regressions:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  SSE 
> 
>  R squared 
> 
>  TSS 
> 
      ROC index 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! Find more information in the Linear Regression lesson.
> 
> ### 7.
> 
> Question 7
> 
> (True/False) It is less concerning to treat a Machine Learning model as a black box for prediction purposes, compared to interpretation purposes:
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the lesson _Supervised Learning for Interpretation and Prediction_.
