# Check for Understanding
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> Which statement about evaluating a Machine Learning model is the most accurate?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Model selection involves choosing a model that minimizes the cost function. 
> 
      Model estimation involves choosing parameters that minimize the cost function. 
> 
>  Model estimation involves choosing a cost function that can be compared across models. 
> 
>  Model selection involves choosing modeling parameters that minimize in-sample validation error. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the lesson _Introduction to Linear Regression_.
>
