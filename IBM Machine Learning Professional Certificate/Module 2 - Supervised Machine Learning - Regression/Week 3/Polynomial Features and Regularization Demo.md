# Polynomial Features and Regularization Demo
> 
> In this demonstration, you will import a data set that contains white noise and add it to a function you will generate, which will allow you to measure the effects of using polynomial features and regularization. Before following along with the videos, download the Jupyter notebook, and then open it in your preferred Python IDE.
