> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> (True/False) The variance of a model is determined by the degree of irreducible error.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  True 
> 
      False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the Bias Trade Off lesson.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> (True/False) As more variables are added to a model, both its complexity and its variance generally increase.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the Bias Trade Off lesson.
> 
> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> (True/False) Model adjustments that decrease bias also decrease variance, leading to a bias-variance tradeoff.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  True 
> 
      False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the Bias Trade Off lesson.
> 
> ### 4.
> 
> Question 4
> 
> Which of the following statements about scaling features prior to regularization is TRUE?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  The scale or features must be the same to implement L1 or L2 regularization. 
> 
>  Features should rarely or never be scaled prior to implementing regularization. 
> 
      The larger a feature’s scale, the more likely its estimated impact will be influenced by regularization. 
> 
>  The smaller a feature’s scale, the more likely its estimated impact will be influenced by regularization. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the Regularization Techniques lesson.
> 
> ### 5.
> 
> Question 5
> 
> Which of the following statements about model complexity is TRUE?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Higher model complexity leads to a lower chance of overfitting. 
> 
      Higher model complexity leads to a higher chance of overfitting. 
> 
>  Reducing the number of features while adding feature interactions leads to a lower chance of overfitting. 
> 
>  Reducing the number of features while adding feature interactions leads to a higher chance of overfitting. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### 6.
> 
> Question 6
> 
> (True/False) A model with high variance is characterized by sensitivity to small changes in input data.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Correct
> 
> ### 7.
> 
> Question 7
> 
> Which of the following statements about Elastic Net regression is TRUE?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization. 
> 
>  Elastic Net does not use L1 or L2 regularization. 
> 
>  Elastic Net uses L2 regularization, as with Ridge regression. 
> 
>  Elastic Net uses L1 regularization, as with Ridge regression. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the Regularization Techniques lesson.
