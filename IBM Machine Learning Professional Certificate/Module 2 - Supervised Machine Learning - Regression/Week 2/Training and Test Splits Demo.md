> 
> In this lab, you will use the Ames Housing data set to train a linear regression using train and test splits. You will use best practices for supervised Machine Learning, including encoding of your categorical variables, training several models, and selecting the one that best fits your error tolerance.
> 
> Download the data and Jupyter notebook, and then open the notebook in your preferred Python IDE. 
> 
> After you've answered the questions on your own, compare your code and answers to the code presented in the solution videos.
