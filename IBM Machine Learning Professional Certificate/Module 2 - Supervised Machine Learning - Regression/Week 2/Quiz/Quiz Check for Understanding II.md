> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> If a low-complexity model is underfitting during estimation, which of the following is MOST LIKELY true (holding the model constant)?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
      K-fold cross-validation will still lead to underfitting, for any _k_. 
> 
>  K-cross-validation with a small _k_ will reduce or eliminate underfitting. 
> 
>  K-fold cross-validation with a large _k_ will reduce or eliminate underfitting. 
> 
>  None of the above. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the cross-validation lesson.

> ### 4.
> 
> Question 4
> 
> Which of the following statements about a high-complexity model in a linear regression setting is TRUE?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Cross-validation with a small _k_ will reduce or eliminate overfitting. 
> 
      A high variance of parameter estimates across cross-validation subsamples indicates likely overfitting. 
> 
>  A low variance of parameter estimates across cross-validation subsamples indicates likely overfitting. 
> 
>  Cross-validation with a large _k_ will reduce or eliminate overfitting. 
> 
> Correct

> Correct! You can find more information in the cross-validation lesson.
