# Check for Understanding III
> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> What is the main goal of adding polynomial features to a linear regression?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Remove the linearity of the regression and turn it into a polynomial model. 
> 
      Capture the relation of the outcome with features of higher order. 
> 
>  Increase the interpretability of a black box model. 
> 
>  Ensure similar results across all folds when using K-fold cross validation. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct! You can find more information in the Polynomial Regression lesson.
