> 1 / 1 point
> 

      CSV files are rows of data or values separated by commas.

>  CSV makes data readily available for analytics, dashboards, and reports. 
> 
>  CSV files are a standard way to store data across platforms. 
>

> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> What are residuals?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Residuals are a method for handling identified outliers. 
> 
>  Residuals are data removed from the dataframe. 
> 

      Residuals are the difference between the actual values and the values predicted by a given model. 
> 
>  Residuals are a method to standardize data. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Residuals are model prediction errors.
> 
> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> If removal of rows or columns of data is not an option, why must we ensure that information is assigned for missing data?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Missing data may bias the dataset. 
> 
>  Information must be assigned to prevent outliers. 
> 

      Most models will not accept blank values in our data. 
> 
>  Assigning information for missing data improves the accuracy of the dataset. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Information must be given for every feature and label in a dataset.
> 
> ### 4.
> 
> Question 4
> 
> What are the two main data problems companies face when getting started with artificial intelligence/machine learning?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Lack of training and expertise 
> 
>  Outliers and duplicated data 
> 
>  Data sampling and categorization 
> 

      Lack of relevant data and bad data 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Companies need to collect and organize their data to make it ready before leveraging it for machine learning.
> 
> ### 5.
> 
> Question 5
> 
> What does SQL stand for and what does it represent?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it represents a set of relational databases with fixed schemas. 
> 
>  SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it represents databases that are not relational, they vary in structure. 
> 
>  SQL stands for Sequential Query Language, and it represents a set of relational databases with fixed schemas. 
> 
>  SQL stands for Sequential Query Language, and it represents a set of sequential databases with fixed schemas. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. SQL is the set of highly structured relational databases with fixed schema.
> 
> ### 6.
> 
> Question 6
> 
> What does NoSQL stand for and what does it represent?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  NoSQL stands for Non-Structured Query Language, and it represents a set of relational databases with fixed schemas. 
> 
>  NoSQL stands for Not-only SQL, and it represents a set of databases that are relational, therefore, they have fixed structure. 
> 
>  NoSQL stands for Non-Structured Query Language, and it represents a set of non-relational databases with varied schemas. 
> 

      NoSQL stands for Not-only SQL, and it represents a set of databases that are not relational, therefore, they vary in structure. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Review the Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation-Background video.
> 
> ### 7.
> 
> Question 7
> 
> What is a JSON file?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  JSON stands for JavaString Object Notation, and it is a standard way to store the data across platforms. 
> 
>  JSON stands for JavaString Object Notation, and they have very similar structure to Python Dictionaries. 
> 
>  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it is a non-standard way to store the data across platforms. 
> 

      JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it is a standard way to store the data across platforms. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and those files are going to be a standard way to store data across platforms.
> 
> ### 8.
> 
> Question 8
> 
> What is meant by the Messy Data?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Duplicated or unnecessary data. 
> 
>  Inconsistent text and typos. 
> 
>  Missing data. 
> 

      All of the above. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Duplicated or unnecessary data, inconsistent text and typos, and missing data are all examples of the messy data.
> 
> ### 9.
> 
> Question 9
> 
> What is an outlier?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Outlier is a data point that does not belong in our dataset. 
> 
>  Outlier is a data point that is very close to the mean value of all observations. 
> 
>  Outlier is a data point that has the highest or lowest value in the dataset. 
> 

      Outlier is an observation in dataset that is distant from most other observations. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. An outlier is an observation in data that is distinct from most other observations.
> 
> ### 10.
> 
> Question 10
> 
> How do we identify outliers in our dataset?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      We can identify outliers both visually and with statistical calculations. 
> 
>  We can only identify outliers by using some statistical calculations. 
> 
>  We can only identify outliers visually through building plots. 
> 
>  We can identify outliers only by calculating the minimum and maximum values in the dataset. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. We can use plots, such as histograms, density, and box plots, as well as making some statistical calculations, such as calculating the interquartile ranges.
