> ### 1.
> 
> Question 1
> 
> Which scaling approach converts features to standard normal variables?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      Standard scaling 
> 
>  Nearest neighbor scaling 
> 
>  Robust scaling 
> 
>  MinMax scaling 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Standard scaling converts variables to standard normal variables.
> 
> ### 2.
> 
> Question 2
> 
> Which variable transformation should you use for ordinal data?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      Ordinal encoding 
> 
>  Min-max scaling 
> 
>  One-hot encoding 
> 
>  Standard scaling 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Use ordinal encoding if there is some order to the categorical features.
> 
> ### 3.
> 
> Question 3
> 
> What are polynomial features?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  They are represented by linear relationships in the data. 
> 
>  They are logistic regression coefficients. 
> 

      They are higher order relationships in the data. 
> 
>  They are lower order relationships in the data. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Polynomial features are estimated by higher order polynomials in a linear model, like squared, cubed, etc.
> 
> ### 4.
> 
> Question 4
> 
> What does Boxcox transformation do?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  It makes the data more left skewed 
> 

      It transforms the data distribution into more symmetrical bell curve 
> 
>  It makes the data more right skewed. 
> 
>  It transforms categorical variables into numerical variables. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Boxcox is one of the ways we can transform our skewed dataset to be more normally distributed.
> 
> ### 5.
> 
> Question 5
> 
> Select three important reasons why EDA is useful.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  To utilize summary statistics, to create visualizations, and to identify outliers 
> 
>  To examine correlations, to sample from dataframes, and to train models on random samples of data 
> 
>  To analyze data sets, to determine the main characteristics of data sets, and to use sampling to examine data 
> 

      To determine if the data makes sense, to determine whether further data cleaning is needed, and to help identify patterns and trends in the data 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. EDA helps us analyze data to summarize its main characteristics.
> 
> ### 6.
> 
> Question 6
> 
> What assumption does the linear regression model make about data?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  This model assumes a transformation of each parameter to a linear relationship. 
> 

      This model assumes a linear relationship between predictor variables and outcome variables. 
> 
>  This model assumes an addition of each one of the model parameters multiplied by a coefficient. 
> 
>  This model assumes that raw data in data sets is on the same scale. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between predictor and outcome variables.
> 
> ### 7.
> 
> Question 7
> 
> What is skewed data?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      Data that is distorted away from normal distribution; may be positively or negatively skewed. 
> 
>  Raw data that may not have a linear relationship. 
> 
>  Data that has a normal distribution. 
> 
>  Raw data that has undergone log transformation. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Often raw data, both the features and the outcome variable, can be negatively or positively skewed.
> 
> ### 8.
> 
> Question 8
> 
> Select the two primary types of categorical feature encoding.
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  One-hot encoding and ordinal encoding 
> 
>  Encoding and scaling 
> 

      Nominal encoding and ordinal encoding 
> 
>  Log and polynomial transformation 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Encoding that transforms non-numeric values to numeric values is often applied to categorical features.
> 
> ### 9.
> 
> Question 9
> 
> Which scaling approach puts values between zero and one?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 

      Min-max scaling 
> 
>  Robust scaling 
> 
>  Nearest neighbor scaling 
> 
>  Standard scaling 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Min-max scaling converts variables to continuous variables in the (0, 1) interval by mapping minimum values to 0 and maximum values to 1.
> 
> ### 10.
> 
> Question 10
> 
> Which variable transformation should you use for nominal data with multiple different values within the feature?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Standard scaling 
> 
>  Ordinal encoding 
> 

      One-hot encoding 
> 
>  Min-max scaling 
> 
> Correct
> 
> Correct. Use one-hot encoding if there are multiple different values within a feature.
