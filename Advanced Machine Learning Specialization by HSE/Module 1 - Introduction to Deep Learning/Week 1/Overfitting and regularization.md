      Overfitting is a situation where a model gives lower quality for new data compared to quality on a training sample

      Large model weights can indicate that model is overfitted

      It can give biased quality estimates for small samples

      It is sensitive to the particular split of the sample into training and test parts

      Regularization restricts model complexity (namely the scale of the coefficients) to reduce overfitting

      Weight penalty drives model parameters closer to zero and prevents the model from being too sensitive to small changes in features

>  Reducing the training sample size makes data simpler and then leads to better quality
