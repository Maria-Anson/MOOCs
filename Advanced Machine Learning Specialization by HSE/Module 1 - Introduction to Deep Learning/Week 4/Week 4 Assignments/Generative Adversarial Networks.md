## Generative Adversarial Networks

*Warning! This assignment requires several hours of computation, because it
contains training of a real world neural network architecture on a CPU, which we
think is essential for learning deep learning. We recommend to use offline
instructions at the bottom to setup your own environment (Docker or Anaconda).
If it's not an option, you can proceed with Coursera Notebooks, but do expect
kernel interruptions. In the meantime we're adding model checkpointing to our
tasks, this should help to continue from where you left off. We think the time
to setup your own environment is worth the comfort throughout the course.*

This is the notebook for generative adversarial networks assignment.

Coursera Jupyter Environment can be slow if many learners use it heavily. Our
tasks are compute-heavy and we recommend to run them on your hardware for
optimal performance. For instructions follow
