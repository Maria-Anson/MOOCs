# Your first CNN on CIFAR-10
> 
> _Warning! This assignment requires **several hours** of computation, because it contains training of a real world neural network architecture on a CPU, which we think is essential for learning deep learning. We recommend to use offline instructions at the bottom to setup your own environment (Docker or Anaconda). If it's not an option, you can proceed with Coursera Notebooks, but do expect kernel interruptions. In the meantime we're adding model checkpointing to our tasks, this should help to continue from where you left off. We think the time to setup your own environment is worth the comfort throughout the course._

> In this task you will build your first Convolutional Neural Network!
> 
> More specifically you will do the following:
> 
> 1\. Define your first CNN architecture for CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 32x32 colour images from 10 classes: **airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck**:

> 3\. Visualise learnt filters like this:

> You will see ## GRADED PART, DO NOT CHANGE! in some cells that are meant for grading. You must run them to submit your answers to graded assignment parts. You can send partial answers to see your progress on the task.
> 
> Good luck!
