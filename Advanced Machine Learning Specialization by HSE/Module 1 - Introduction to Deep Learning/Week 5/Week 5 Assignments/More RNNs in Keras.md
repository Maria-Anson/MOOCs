## More RNNs in Keras

In this notebook we'll learn how to build RNN/LSTM/GRU easily with keras.

Coursera Jupyter Environment can be slow if many learners use it heavily. Our
tasks are compute-heavy and we recommend to run them on your hardware for
optimal performance. For instructions follow

If something goes wrong, make sure you have nltk==3.2.4 and a stable internet
connection.
