# Question 1

## Which library provides the most convenient way to perform matrix multiplication?

**Correct**** answers:**

* It's a linear algebra library.

**Incorrect answers:**

* This one is about data reading/processing, not algebra.
* This one is about ML algorithms.
* This one is about GBDT.



# Question 2

## Which libraries contain implementations of linear models?

**Correct**** answers:**

* This one is about ML algorithms including linear models

**Incorrect answers:**

* . This one is about data reading/processing.
* This one is about linear algebra. It can be used for implementing linear model,
but this is not working out-of-box.
* This one is about visualizations.
* This one is about dimensionality reduction.



# Question 3

## Which library (or libraries) are used to train a neural network?

**Correct**** answers:**

* This one is about neural networks, so yes, this is the right answer.
* This one is about neural networks, so yes, this is the right answer.
* This one is about neural networks, so yes, this is the right answer.

**Incorrect answers:**

* This one is about linear algebra. It can be used for implementing NN, but you
should hardcode all gradient calculations.
* This one is about data visualization.
* This one is about dimensionality reduction



# Question 4

## Select the correct statements about the RandomForest and GBDT models.

**Correct**** answers:**

* Right, since each tree is independent from other trees.
* True, the idea of boosting is to correct errors of previously learned models..

**Incorrect answers:**

* No, we need to build trees in sequential manner. In XGBoost multiple cores are
used to build single tree.
* No, every tree is independent.
