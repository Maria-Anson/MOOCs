> 
> Total points 4
> 
>  1.Question 1
> 
> Which of these methods are used by organizers to prevent overfitting to the test set using scores from the leaderboard?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Splitting test for public/private 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> The submissions are scored on public part of the test set while private score is only revealed when competition ends, thus it is not possible to overfit to private part
> 
>  Shuffling order of rows in train and test sets 
> 

      Adding non-relevant samples to test set 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Non-relevant samples make it much harder to do "leaderboard probing", i.e. get labels of individual objects based on leaderboard score
> 

      Limiting number of submissions per day 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> This also makes "leaderboard probing" much harder
