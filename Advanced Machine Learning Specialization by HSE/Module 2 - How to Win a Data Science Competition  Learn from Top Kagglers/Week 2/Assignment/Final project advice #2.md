## Final project advice #2

*****

A good exercise is to reproduce *previous_value_benchmark*. As the name suggest
- in this benchmark for the each shop/item pair our predictions are just monthly
sales from the previous month, i.e. October 2015.

The most important step at reproducing this score is correctly aggregating daily
data and constructing monthly sales data frame. You need to get
[lagged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag_operator) values, fill NaNs with
zeros and clip the values into [0,20] range. If you do it correctly,  you'll get
precisely 1.16777 on the public leaderboard.

Generating features like this is a necessary basis for more complex models.
Also, if you decide to fit some model, don't forget to clip the target into
[0,20] range, it makes a big difference.
