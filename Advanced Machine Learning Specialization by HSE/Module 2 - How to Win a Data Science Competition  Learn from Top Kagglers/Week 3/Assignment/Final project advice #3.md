## Final project advice #3

*****

You can get a rather good score after creating some lag-based features like in
advice from previous week and feeding them into gradient boosted trees model.

Apart from item/shop pair lags you can try adding lagged values of total shop or
total item sales (which are essentially mean-encodings). All of that is going to
add some new information.
