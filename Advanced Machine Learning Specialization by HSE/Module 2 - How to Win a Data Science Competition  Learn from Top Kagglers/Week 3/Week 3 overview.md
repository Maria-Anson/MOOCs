## Week 3 overview

*****

Welcome to the third week of the "How to Win a Data Science Competition" course!
Here is a short summary of what you will learn.

* *Dmitry Ulyanov  *will start this week with analysis of **evaluation
****m****etrics**. We will recap the most prominent ones for tasks of
classification and regression, examine them for the best constant predictions to
create simple baselines in competitions, and then see, how we can efficiently
optimize a specific metric in a particular competition.

* *Dmitry Altukhov  *will discuss very powerful technique for feature generation -
**mean encodings**. We will start with categorical features, analyze how
mean-encoded features lead to overfitting and overview how can we balance
overfitting with regularization. Then, we will discuss several extensions to
this approach, including applying mean-encodings to time series, numeric
features and combinations of features. In the  you will need to implement
several regularization techniques for mean encodings.

To keep up the work on the , apply ideas we will discuss and improve your
current solution by checking the metric you optimize and by adding mean-encoded
features.

Now let's go ahead and get started!
