# Initial Data Exploration
> 
> Once you've identified a Use Case and Data Set it is time to get familiar with data. In the process model this task is called Initial Data Exploration. Please take a minute or two to (re)visit the following lecture
> 
> [https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology) Module 2 - Data Understanding
> 
> Please also revisit [http://coursera.org/learn/ds/](http://coursera.org/learn/ds/) Module 3 - Mathematical Foundations and Module 4 - Visualizations
> 
> Given the lectures above, please create statistics and visualization on your Data Set to identify good columns for modeling, potential data quality issues and anticipate potential feature transformations necessary.
> 
> Create a jupyter notebook where you document your code and include visualizations as first deliverable. Please also stick to the naming conventions explained in the the process model manual.
> 
> So, the most important reasons / steps are:
> 
> - Identify quality issues (e.g. missing values, wrong measurements, …)
> 
> - Assess feature quality – how relevant is a certain measurement (e.g. use correlation matrix)
> 
> - Get an idea on the value distribution of your data using statistical measures and visualizations
