# Architectural Decisions Document (ADD)
> 
> As the process model is paired with architectural decision guidelines in an iterative fashion one of the deliverables is an architectural decisions document containing the technology mapping between architectural components and concrete technologies. In addition to the mapping, a justification for the decision of the mapping is required so that resources entering the project at a later stage can retrace the thinking threads of current project decision makers.
> 
> Please use the template provided below and start filling the gaps in the document. As the whole process model is iterative, it is favored behavior if this document evolves during the creation of the capstone deliverables.
