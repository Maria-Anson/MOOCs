# Process Model Guidelines
> 
> Each step (stop) in the process model comes with a set of guidelines. Please make sure you check them out on the link below and also document any decisions you've made (using the guidelines or your experience or both) as comments/documentation in your deliverables (e.g. jupyther notebooks).
> 
> Keeping source and documentation as tight as possible is highly recommended. So please make use of comments in the code directly and in sections above and below the code.
> 
> And please keep in mind, good software projects have as much documentation in the code as actual code itself.
> 
> Following the guidelines will lead to decisions and hopefully to some good comments in and above the code so that a follow-up data scientists understand what you've done.
