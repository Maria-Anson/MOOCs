# Create ADD - Architectural Decisions Document
> 
> During the curse of the project you’ve made several choices which impact the project. Now it’s time to do a final pass on the document and make sure everything is in shape. Please spend some time on it to really make sure everything is consistent. Imagine, that your successor needs to continue with your project without being able to speak to you, so this document is the only way to understand why and how things are implemented as they are.
