# Extract Transform Load (ETL)
> 
> ETL is one of the first things which needs to be done in a data science project. The nature of this task highly depends on the type of data source. Whether it is relational or unstructured, enterprise data or internet data, persistent data or streaming data. This heavily influences the choice of architecture. Therefore, you must document your choice and thinking process in the Architectural Decision Document (ADD).
> 
> This task involves – as the name implies – accessing the data source, transforming it in a way it can be easily worked with and finally make it available to downstream analytics processes – either real-time streaming or batch ones.
> 
> In case of operational relational data, de-normalization usually needs to take place, for unstructured data, some feature extraction might already be appropriate and for real-time data, windows are usually created.
> 
> Please create an ETL process, document it and save this deliverable according to the naming convention of the process model.
