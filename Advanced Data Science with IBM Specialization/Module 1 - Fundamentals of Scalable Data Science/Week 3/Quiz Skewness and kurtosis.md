> 
> The higher the kurtosis value, the longer the "tails" of the distributions are. So, kurtosis measures the outlier content. The higher the kurtosis value, the more outliers are in the dataset because the more far a values is away from the mean, the more it contributes to the kurtosis. In other words, the distribution has long tails. Which are examples of long tailed datasets?

> 
> Consider a connected car. We are measuring the car's velocity 600 times per minute. Note that in time intervals the car stands the velocity of zero is measured. If we now plot the distribution of velocity values, is this distribution positively or negatively skewed?
> 
> Some further explaination from the discussion forum:
> 
> Just imagine a car driving in Bangalore, so if you measure it's velocity, most of the time it is zero - sometimes it is between 3-5 km/h and rarely above, so please imagine how such a chart looks like if you have velocity on the x axis and frequency (how often you've measured that velocity) on the y axis
