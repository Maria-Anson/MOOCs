> 
> Question 11
> 
> A dialog has the following nodes:
> 
> Welcome (welcome condition)
> 
> Greetings (#greetings intent condition)
> 
> Thank you (#thank_you intent condition)
> 
> Goodbyes (#goodbyes intent condition)
> 
> Anything else (anything_else condition).
> 
> Which of the following statements apply?
> 
> 3 / 3 points
> 

      Welcome will contain the chatbot prompt and be executed at the beginning of the conversation. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Yes.
> 
>  Greetings overshadows Goodbyes, and therefore Goodbyes is never executed. 
> 
>  The order of Welcome and Anything else in the dialog will generally not matter. 
> 

      In this case, rearranging the order to be Welcome, Thank You, Greetings, Goodbyes and Anything else would not cause problems. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> You got it!
> 

      If no known intent is detected in the user input, the Anything else node will be executed.
