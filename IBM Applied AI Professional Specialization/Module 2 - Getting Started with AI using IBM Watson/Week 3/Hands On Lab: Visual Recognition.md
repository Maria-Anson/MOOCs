## Exploring Watson Visual Recognition

IBM provides an online demo of Watson Visual Recognition at: [Watson Visual
Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition/demo/#demo)
(or from the product page, click Demo).  

The demo environment provides two models for analysis:

* Custom Models, which businesses use to recognize any object, scene or attribute
to solve their unique challenges.
* Pre Trained Models, which are category specific to enable you to analyze images
for scenes, objects, faces, colors, food, and other content.

In this demo, you will use Watson Visual Recognition to analyze images, first
with the Custom Model, and then with the Pre Trained Models.



### Use the following steps to explore the demo:

**Custom Model**

1.  Access the online demo here: [Watson Visual
Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition/demo/#demo)
1.  Close the message box that begins “This system is for demonstration purposes
only….”
1.  Look at the image - what do you see?
1.  Under **Insurance (Custom Classifier)**, review the options.
1.  What level of confidence does Watson have that the image is of:
1.  a flat tire 
1.  vandalism 
1.  a broken windshield 
1.  a motorcycle accident 
1.  Repeat this process for each of the sample images.



**Pre Trained Models**

1.  Select the image of the person in the tweed jacket.
1.  Under General Model, review the options. Note that Watson has identified
characteristics that exist in the image.
1.  What level of confidence does Watson have that the image is of:
1.  fabric 
1.  gray color 
1.  Harris Tweed (jacket) 
1.  clothing 
1.  Select the image of liquid in a beaker.
1.  Under General Model, review the options. Watson can identify characteristics
that exist in the image.
1.  What level of confidence does Watson have that the image is of:
1.  chocolate color 
1.  beverage
1.  food
1.  Expand **Food Model**. Watson can Identify meals and food items with enhanced
accuracy. 

15. What level of confidence does Watson have that the image is of:

16. a non-food

17. Repeat this process for each image.

18. Expand **Explicit Model**. Watson can determine if an image contains nudity
or other inappropriate content.

19. What level of confidence does Watson have that the image does not contain
explicit content?

20. Repeat this process for each image.

**Optional**

1.  Choose an image file of your own and drag it to the **Drop Image here** **or
Click to Upload** box.
1.  Examine the results.
