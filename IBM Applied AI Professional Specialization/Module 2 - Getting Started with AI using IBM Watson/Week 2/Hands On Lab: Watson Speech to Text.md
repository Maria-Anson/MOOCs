IBM provides an online demo of Watson Speech to Text at: [Watson Speech to
Text](https://speech-to-text-demo.ng.bluemix.net/?cm_mc_uid=59963159489715526067556&cm_mc_sid_50200000=93080491558737820643&cm_mc_sid_52640000=17830021558737820661)
(or from the product page, click Demo).  

The demo environment has several ways you can provide audio:

* Record Audio - uses your microphone to record audio.
* Upload Audio File - allows you to upload an .mp3, .mpeg, .wav, .flac, or .opus

* Play a sample file.



In this demo, you will use Watson Speech to Text to transcribe audio.
