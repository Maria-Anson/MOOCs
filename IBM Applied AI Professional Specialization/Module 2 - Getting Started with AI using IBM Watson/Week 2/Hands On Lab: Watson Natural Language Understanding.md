“Morehouse College, the private, all-male, historically black college in Atlanta
that counts Martin Luther King among its alumni, expects its attendees to aspire
to greatness. Soon, many in the graduating class of 2019 can start doing so, no
matter the cost.

Tech billionaire Robert Smith's surprise pledge during his commencement speech
last weekend to pay off 396 graduates' college loan debts is a potentially
$40-million US game changer for a generation of African-American grads. It
removes an economic millstone that might have otherwise limited their
possibilities, or at least slowed their progress.

The Morehouse class of 2019 has been spared what might have amounted to decades
of monthly payments. Smith delivered the kind of relief that can pay dividends
for a de-stressed cohort of young professionals. Social psychology research
suggests it could inspire a positive contagion effect, with generosity trickling
downstream from past grads to new students.”
