## Watson in use at Woodside

*****

This case study represents just one of the successful implementations of Watson
AI services across the world. You may recognize this company and the features in
use from other modules in this course and the Introduction to AI course. Read
the case study summarized below.

## Woodside

Woodside is Australia's largest independent oil and gas company. It’s an
industry requiring absolute accuracy, and previously Woodside has relied on
historical context and procedural information to ensure precision. The problem
is, that historical context is being lost as the older generation of workers
retires. So, the question for Woodside is how to retain that information in a
way that is accessible and useful for the current workers.

Woodside began a company-wide initiative to gather information, especially from
workers with years of experience nearing retirement. They recognized the value
in spending time to train Watson with that data, and to teach Watson the natural
language the staff use to pose and respond to questions. This effort enabled
engineers to quickly become fully informed of what has been done and how an
issue was managed in the past. With Watson, time spent on researching has been
reduced by 75%.

At Woodside, Watson has engendered a change of mindset – retiring workers are
proud to leave their knowledge as a legacy, and younger workers still benefit
from their years of experience while making their own contributions to the
company knowledge base. 

Like Bradesco, Watson at Woodside learned in five steps:

* **Trained **with over 600,00 pages of documentation. 
* **Tested **the machine learning model was continuously updated to be able to
analyze a higher volume of records. 
* **Launched **Over 80% of employees adopted Watson for their day-to-day work. 
* **Got results** Employees used to spend 80% of their time researching problems
and 20% fixing it. Watson has reversed that. 
* **Keeps learning** Employees are encouraged to provide feedback, whether they’re
brand new or have years of experience. 

The aim for Watson at Woodside is to be innovative and grow. “The biggest thing
in oil and gas is health and safety, and Watson can help us make better
decisions to ensure that,” said Alexander Russo, an IBM Cognitive Engineer.
