>  5.Question 5
> 
> Which of the following is an attribute of Watson Assistant?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Watson Assistant dynamically trains itself with industry-relevant content when first enabled at a customer site. 
> 
>  Watson Assistant needs to be frequently updated on new intents and entities in order to understand similar requests across customers. 
> 
>  Unlike humans Watson assistant does not remember user input. 
> 

      Watson Assistant ensures that customer data is protected. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Watson Assistant ensures that customer-specific data is used to train Watson only for that customer, not others.
> 
>  6.Question 6
> 
> Which of these statements best reflects how businesses are implementing chatbots in customer service?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Businesses are looking to balance customer interactions between human agents and chatbots. 
> 
>  Chatbots are being used to take on all customer queries, without exception. 
> 
>  With the successful implementation of chatbots, businesses are looking at eliminating all human customer service agents. 
> 
>  Chatbots engage in complex customer interactions that require creativity or exceptions to the rules. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Businesses today are looking to balance customer interactions between human agents and chatbots. Chatbots are being used to filter the vast majority of simple and repetitive questions that customers have, leaving human agents free to engage in the complex customer interactions that require creativity or exceptions to the rules.

> 
>  Watson Assistant 
> 
>  Watson Discovery 
> 

      Watson Regulatory Compliance 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Watson Regulatory Compliance turns the manual, time-consuming, and expensive process of complying with regulatory requirements into a streamlined, efficient process, driven by consistent methodology. It combines software, content, and expertise to provide a holistic, accurate, and timely view of the obligation lifecycle that enables organizations to achieve trustworthy, efficient, and sustainable compliance.
> 
>  8.Question 8
> 
> What are three Watson APIs that are particularly useful for organizations that want to create more personalized chatbot experiences?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Personality Insights, Tone Analyzer and Natural Language Classifier. 
> 
>  Personality Insights, Tone Analyzer and Visual Recognition 
> 
>  Tone Analyzer, Natural Language Classifier and Visual Recognition 
> 
>  Personality Insights, Natural Language Classifier and Visual Recognition 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Personality Insights predicts an individual’s personality characteristics, needs, and values to drive personalization. Tone Analyzer is a Watson API that uses linguistic analysis to assess the emotional, social, and linguistic themes in text. Natural Language Classifier analyzes text to label and organize data into custom categories.
> 
>  9.Question 9
> 
> If you were given the responsibility to select an appropriate use case for implementing AI in your organization, which of these two approaches is best?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Focus on selecting a use case that can best demonstrate the benefit of AI to your organization. 
> 
>  Focus on selecting a use case which can be turned around in the fastest possible time so that the organization can decide at the earliest possible. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> The focus for the use case should be to demonstrate the benefits that AI can bring to your organization. If the use case is faster to turn around but does not demonstrate enough value to the organization, it is not the right use case for starting your organization on its AI journey.
>
