> 
> When working in challenging conditions, especially operational sites, the speed at which questions get resolved can be critical. Watson's natural language processing capabilities and conversation APIs help gather expertise from thousands of employees to greatly reduce the time spent on tracking down expert knowledge.
> 
> Watson uses data from sensors to detect moisture levels in the air, helping irrigation systems give water where moisture content is low. Watson ingests data from weather, satellite, and sensor data on the IBM Cloud to identify conditions on the ground and in the atmosphere to adapt the irrigation levels. This not only helps get the best yields but also reduces the water use.
> 
> Every third bite of food we eat is from a pollinated plant. To aid this process, bees sometimes need to be transported long distances. Watson has partnered with The Weather Company to help identify the best routes taking traffic, temperature, and road conditions into account for the safe transportation of bees.

> 
> Which of the following is an attribute of intelligent chatbots?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Intelligent chatbots can only understand the spoken words, not the underlying intent and emotions behind what is being said. 
> 
>  Intelligent chatbots can converse with customers in a unique way, different from how humans interact with each other. 
> 

      An intelligent bot can understand when the customer is best served by a human agent and connects the customer to a human agent for such interactions. 
> 
>  With the use of intelligent bots, customer queries that may require creativity or exceptions are also being handled by bots, eliminating the need for getting a human agent involved. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> The natural language capabilities of Watson powered chatbots enable them to understand the varied emotions in what the customer is saying. This capability enables chatbots to have conversations with customers that are natural and implicit, just the way humans interact with one another. An intelligent chatbot is also capable of deciding when the customer is better served by a human agent and transfer the call to the human agent.
